# RoboticsTestRepo
Use this repository to practice using GitHub.

Step 1: Using the desktop app, clone this repository and then commit your hello world file. (we will talk about this on wednesday)

Step 2: Make a new branch on someone else's code, and comment "Hello [name]" on the top. Then, merge the code. 

Remember to name your commits and explain what they do. 

If you need more information, check out the two presentations we went over during our Wednesday Meeting.
